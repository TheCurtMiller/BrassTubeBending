 Brass Tube Bending Fixtues

This project describes fixture for brass tube bending intended for brass instrument repair or rebuild.  The bending fixture concept is adapted from www.robbstewart.com/bending-tubing. I have substituted 3D printed parts where Robb Stewart used wooden mandrels and tools.  A video of my fixture in use is at https://youtu.be/x603taCZVAw.

The repository includes 3D printed fixture files in STL format.  I got satisfactory results using PLA.  I used 4 layer walls and 8 layer top and bottom with 70% fill.
The base plate for the bending fixture is an aluminum plate 12 x 12 x 5/8 inch with a grid of 5/16 x 18 threaded holes with 3/4 inch pitch.  The Bender Block is designed to fit a piece of 3/4 inch EMT conduit as a handle.
