 Brass Tube Bending Fixtues

This project describes fixture for brass tube bending intended for brass instrument repair or rebuild.  The bending fixture concept is adapted from www.robbstewart.com/bending-tubing. I have substituted 3D printed parts where Robb Stewart used wooden mandrels and tools.
